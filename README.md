This is my first project, i decided not to fix it so could be possible to see difference between first work and the others.

What i learned doing this project:
- design hand-off tool Avacode;
- structure of the html document (html, head, body);
- how to connect CSS to an HTML document and the structure of CSS files;
- how to connect the Google-fonts on the page;
- CSS Flexbox anf float;
- position (absolute,relative);
- before and after elements;
